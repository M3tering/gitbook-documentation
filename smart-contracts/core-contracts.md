## ü§ñ M3ter: ERC-721 contract&#x20;

#### Deployment Address: [<mark style="color:green;">0x39fb420Bd583cCC8Afd1A1eAce2907fe300ABD02</mark>](https://gnosis.nftscan.com/0x39fb420bd583ccc8afd1a1eace2907fe300abd02?module=NFTs) 

M3ter is an ERC-721 (NFT) contract where each NTF represent a smart metering device registerd on-chain by it's manufacturer. Similar to Helium device NFTs on Solana, or Wicrypt device NFTs on polygon.  These devices contain cryptographic secure elements used to sign energy consumption data they measure. the purpose of `keyByTokenId` is to map an NFT's `tokenId` to the cryptographic `PublicKey` for a device (bytes 32 key for ED25519 digital signature scheme), while the `tokenIdByKey` is used to reverse map the above mentioned `PublicKey` to the NTF's `tokenId`

## ü™ô Solaxy: ERC-20 as ERC-4626 contract

#### Deployment Address: [<mark style="color:green;">0xF4F3c1666E750E014DE65c50d0e98B1263E678B8</mark>](https://gnosis.blockscout.com/token/0xF4F3c1666E750E014DE65c50d0e98B1263E678B8?tab=holders)

Solaxy is an ERC-20 token contract that implements a linear bonding curve with sDAI as the reserve currency. The bonding curve allows users to buy and sell Solaxy tokens directly from/to the contract at a dynamic price determined by the curve's slope.&#x20;

Solaxy extends its functionality by providing support for [`ERC-4626`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626); a tokenized vault interface. This interface allows the Solaxy contract to interact with other DeFi protocols and platforms seamlessly. `ERC-4626` integration enhances the capabilities of Solaxy in the context of token bonding curves.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Protocol: PPA pre-payment contract

#### Deployment Address: [<mark style="color:green;">0x2b3997D82C836bd33C89e20fBaEF96CA99F1B24A</mark>](https://gnosis.blockscout.com/address/0x2b3997D82C836bd33C89e20fBaEF96CA99F1B24A?tab=contact\_code)
